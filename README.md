# Finding Easter Eggs
"Finding Easter Eggs" is a university project developed during my Human-Computer Interaction class as part of my Master's program. The project explored two different techniques for helping users orient themselves in a virtual reality (VR) space to find invisible Easter eggs. The experiment aimed to compare proximity-based feedback with directional guidance to determine which method helps users more effectively navigate VR environments.

## Experiment Overview
The project compared two visual guidance methods for locating invisible Easter eggs in a VR environment:

Colored Reticle: A reticle that changed color from red (far) to green (close) as the user looked towards an Easter egg.
Arrow Indicator: An arrow guided the user towards an Easter Egg when he was relatively close.
The experiment was conducted in three levels, with users tasked to find three Easter eggs per level. Once all eggs in a level were found, users were teleported to the next level.

## Participants and Design
- Number of Participants: 10
- Design: Within-subjects 
- Measured Variables
  - Time to Find an Egg: Logged for each egg for both techniques.
  - Head Rotation (Degrees): The amount of head movement required to locate each egg was recorded.
  - Perceived Usability: After each session, participants rated the usability of each technique using the System Usability Scale (SUS).
  - 
## Results
The findings indicated clear differences between the two techniques:

- Time to Find an Egg: Participants found eggs faster using the arrow (median: 3.6 seconds) compared to the colored reticle (median: 11.1 seconds).
- Head Rotation: Less head movement was required when using the arrow.
- Perceived Usability: The arrow received a higher usability rating (median SUS score: 80) compared to the reticle (median SUS score: 67).

## Conclusion

The experiment demonstrated that the arrow indicator, which provided directional guidance, significantly outperformed the colored reticle, which only indicated proximity. Participants found Easter eggs more quickly and with less head movement using the arrow, showing that directional cues are more effective for helping users orient themselves in a virtual space.

Additionally, the arrow received higher usability ratings, indicating that users found it more intuitive and easier to navigate with. Overall, providing clear directional guidance proved to be a better strategy for VR navigation.
